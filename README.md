# wp-tech-reggie
An inventory of discovered tech services and associated data.

There is a large universe of software and services out there for learning delivery. In order to utilize any of them, there are processes that must be followed. This Wordpress plugin creates a custom post type of "Services" which allows you to enter a service and track its associated data. Building a registry of services saves time and effort by creating a starting point to:

- Look up information on existing services
- Submit new services


A rough list of meta data to associate with each service:
